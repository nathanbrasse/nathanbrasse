I'm an indie data analyst and writer who builds end-to-end solutions from the ground up. Each project starts with a business question and a blank whiteboard and ends with something real, whether it's a deployed model, an automated workflow, or an analysis that drives action. I focus on impact, aligning with stakeholders early and making technical results clear and useful for decision-makers.
